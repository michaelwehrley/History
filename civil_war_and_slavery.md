* Editor and founder  of the abolitionist newspaper *The Liberator* in 1831

* "NO COMPROMISE WITH THE EVIL OF SLAVERY", SPEECH, 1854

> The abolitionism which I advocate is as absolute as the law of God, and as unyielding as his throne. It admits of no compromise. Every slave is a stolen man; every slaveholder is a man stealer. By no precedent, no example, no law, no compact, no purchase, no bequest, no inheritance, no combination of circumstances, is slaveholding right or justifiable.
